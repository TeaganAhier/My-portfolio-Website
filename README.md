## Summary
This portfolio was created as part of my Web Programming module and serves as my first personal website. It represents my early design skills, responsive layout knowledge, and ability to structure a multi-page site from scratch. I plan to continue expanding it with AI/ML projects, coursework, and personal builds as my experience grows.
